package demo.List;

//Each element is data value itself and reference pointing to next element
//it has node has data and node of any type
//next node will be of type node
//LinkedList class has some features
//we require three classes 1- node 2-methods for ll 3- main method

//node --> int data, node next
//Linked list --> insert, insertAt, delete - specify index, show, insert at start
//Main -->

//LinkedList and ArrayList Difference
//both are implementation of List
//difference lies in implementation
//array is implemented with dynamic array
//ll is implemented with double ll, it is fast if we want to assign values in between
//arraylist is slow
